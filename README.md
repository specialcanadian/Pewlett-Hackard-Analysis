# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## This analysis was done for a fictional company to determine how many roles will need to be filled as many of the older employees retire. A secondary objective is finding soon-to retire employees that can act as mentors for newer ones. 

 
## Results
- From the retiring titles file, we see that, as expected, many Senior engineers and Senior staff are retiring soon. 

- A very low amount of managers seem to be retiring 

-From deliverable 2, we have a selection of soon-to retire workers who could be mentors for the next generation of employees. 
 
## Summary
- 41,138 Roles will soon be vacant

- With about 41,000 employees retiring, and around 2,000 mentors, each mentor would need to train about 20 people to fill all the positions
